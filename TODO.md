# TODO for Making Contact Info Side by Side on Mobile

- [x] Modify the grid layout in src/components/Contact.tsx to display phone, email, and location side by side on mobile screens instead of stacked vertically
- [x] Test the changes by running the development server and verifying the layout on mobile view
