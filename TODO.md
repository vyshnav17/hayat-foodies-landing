# TODO: Add Phone and Email to Contact Component Side by Side for Mobile

- [ ] Update Contact.tsx to include phone numbers and email in a contact section
- [ ] Ensure the contact info is displayed side by side in a single row on mobile view
- [ ] Place the contact section after company name/location and before social links
- [ ] Use responsive flex layout: flex-row on mobile, adjust for larger screens if needed
- [ ] Add Phone and Mail icons from lucide-react to imports (already imported)
- [ ] Test the layout on mobile view (dev server running at http://localhost:8080/)
