# TODO for Adding Gradient to Hero Bread Image

- [x] Update the background overlay in `src/components/Hero.tsx` to use a gradient from 30% opacity at the top to 70% opacity at the bottom for better text visibility.
- [x] Test the changes by running the development server and verifying the "Hayat Foods India" text is clearly visible.
