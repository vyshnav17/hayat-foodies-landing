# TODO: Add Phone and Email to Contact Component Side by Side for Mobile

- [x] Update Contact.tsx to include phone numbers and email in a contact section
- [x] Ensure the contact info is displayed side by side in a single row on mobile view
- [x] Place the contact section after company name/location and before social links
- [x] Use responsive flex layout: flex-row on mobile, adjust for larger screens if needed
- [x] Add Phone and Mail icons from lucide-react to imports (already imported)
- [x] Test the layout on mobile view (dev server running at http://localhost:8080/)
